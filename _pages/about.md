# Who am I?

I'm a game and software developer, currently working on projects for Android and Windows, with future plans for Mac, Linux and iOS/iPad. I also like to create music, videos, tech and game reviews, I hoard old and new tech, make weird inventions on both paper and IRL, I browse a lot of reddit, Twitter, Steam, Discord and YouTube, and listen to music on YT Music or Spotify a huge chunk of the day while coding or simply doing nothing. Furthermore, I'm Bi and a Furry.

Not only that, but I'm a fan of whatever devices Google, Samsung, Sony, Apple or ZTE create, thankfully I also get the occasion from time to time to test such devices. Check the list at the bottom of the page to see what I tested.

**Keep in mind I am biased, like literally everyone else.** I prefer Kaspersky and Bitdefender over every single antivirus solution out there, extremely biased against Epic Games (excluding Unreal Engine, that is excellent for what I need), biased against Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, Facebook, TikTok, anti-vaxxers, and religion. Expect remarks about these companies and topics if we're talking about them in a post here.

I am trying to be as formal and professional as possible here, but emotions (anger, sadness, indifference) and biases may slip up sometimes. I apologize in advance if that happens.

# Life roadmap

*Not since birth, but since I started programming and stuff. Some years and events are missing from pretty obvious reasons about privacy

##### 2011 (or 2012)

- First tablet, a Serioux S716 Tab with 512MB RAM, 1.2Ghz processor and 2GB of storage. Sadly the tab died four years later, may try to revive it someday.
- First computer, a Compaq office computer with Windows 2000, a floppy drive, and no Internet connection. Did not check its specs, so I don't know anything else other than I used to play Solitaire and Pinball 3D on it.

##### 2014

- New tablet, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0", (presently running a custom ROM with Android 4.4.4 KitKat, ROMs are very scarce for this board), running out of box Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Still runs today, mostly runs smaller games and used for YouTube and drawing in the free time.

##### 2015

- First time editing HTML, CSS

##### 2016

- First time making a small mod for Minecraft PE
- First time making a texture pack for Minecraft PE

##### 2018

- Better PC (Not actually that good by today's standards. Dell OptiPlex with Pentium D, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 Ultra 512 MiB, 2 GB of (pretty effing corrupt DDR2 RAM))
- Became very good at HTML, CSS, started using UE4
- JumpGame is developed and released (v.0.1), then subsequently cancelled in favour of GRAV0RTAL
- GRAV0RTAL is announced, a few devlogs will be released until 2020. Barely any development is made, considering I barely started using Unreal and still need more knowledge to create a project of this scale
- 2A Games is created (indie studio) with co-developer and long-time friend, Alin9700

##### 2019

- More GRAV0RTAL development updates are released
- Became better at Unreal Engine 4, already considering cancelling the project
- GRAV0RTAL is cancelled for the first time
- Portal Stories: New Age is ramping up for the announcement in 9 Dec 2019

##### 2020

- GRAV0RTAL is back. For realzies this time, I promise! (Spoiler, cancelled the same year lmao)
- 2A Games is renamed to Evo-Catalyst Softworks
- TheVirus™ strikes Romania, anti-vaxxers are back, woo! (f--k them)
- Devlogs 1-2 are released for GRAV0RTAL
- Released a few soundtracks I sketched for GRAV0RTAL
- New PC, finally some good effing gaming ensues! (HP Compaq 8200 Elite, Intel Core i7-2600 vPro, now 9 years old, still holds VERY well, 8 GB DDR3, AMD 512 MB GPU, soon replaced with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650)
- New PC's PSU has issues and is replaced, thankfully nothing was lost
- Added an extra 500 GB HDD that's possibly been running for 2+ years and shows signs of failure from a different computer
- Evo-Catalyst Studios is renamed to Vanta Interactive (current name)
- Project C.U.B.E. is announced - no one seems to care anyway - then a few months later gets silently removed and cancelled, *may get revived someday under a different codename*.
- GRAV0RTAL gets cancelled 5 days before Christmas. Merry Christmas! (or not) The project files are released soon after as well. You can't download them anymore, I deleted them.
- Unbeknownst to many, I cancelled everything publicly because I thought people would just get bored and lose interest if there's no progress to be shown, and that I would disappoint them, not only that, but I wanted to become better at Unreal 4. I pretty much added a few lies in for taste.

##### 2021

- This website is made in the summer of 2021
- I get very addicted to HITMAN 2 and HITMAN III, also to YT Music
- Start a few modding projects that will not be worked on for quite some time, considering it's all hands on deck for Project Hangar
- Scalenium development is started, no big announcement
- One year of Vanta Interactive not announcing anything, no one seems to care (actually good imo, I can stop being stressed about this and focus on my projects)
- Frosted Planet has a lot of issues with the art style, features, story, models. First I thought I would make it on a fictional planet that was frozen by humans in order to repopulate it, then I want it voxel-styled like ASTRONEER, then I want it NMS-style, then normal high-quality models style, which seemed to work for a while. Story gets written, promptly cancelled for the super secret Project Hangar.
- By this time, Unreal 5 Preview 2 was released, and as of September, I'm now pretty effing good at Unreal (4&5). Not an expert, but not a medium-level developer either. I also shifted every project to Unreal 5 and never looked back.
- This website gets more articles, content and now, this roadmap. Hi there!
- TheVirus™ Phase 4 (Delta variant) is ~~almost~~ here, woo!
- Let's not forget Omicron, an anagram for 'moron', which is the person that doesn't want to vaccinate because of "muh freedoms".

*In case you're asking, no, I will not announce Project Hangar or the unnamed project until it's time. I will not do this crap ever again (GRAV0RTAL cancelled, announced again, cancelled again, slow progress, few lies mixed in for taste). This means for Project Hangar that I will likely announce it only a few short months before its release, by then play-testing, media is done, bug fixes are the highest priority, and I'll start being active, releasing info about it. After announcement, the Steam page will be public.
