I'm a game and software developer, currently working on projects for Android and Windows, with future plans for Mac, Linux and iOS/iPad. I also like to create music, videos, tech and game reviews, I hoard old and new tech, make weird inventions on both paper and IRL, I browse a lot of reddit, Twitter, Steam, Discord and YouTube, and listen to music on YT Music or Spotify a huge chunk of the day while coding or simply doing nothing. I'm Bi and a Furry.

I'm a fan of whatever devices Google, Samsung, Sony, Apple or ZTE create, thankfully I also get the occasion from time to time to test such devices.

# Aspirations

# Interests

I like:

- Computers
- Tech
- Mobile phones, tablets, laptops
- Games/Gaming
- Programming
- Conceptualizing
- Listening to music, most notably on YT Music
- Piracy (I condone piracy in certain cases, don't @ me, also not an active pirate anymore)
- Birds
- Software
- Art
- Architecture
- Medicine
- Logics
- Psychology
- Chatting
- Browsing Twitter, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, reddit
- Space, Astronomy, Galaxies, Planets, etc.
- Food
- Music (most notably chill, hip-hop, retro, classical, modern, electronic, reggae, dance, pop)
- Helping others on subjects like tech support, what antivirus should someone choose (my recommendation: Kaspersky Security Cloud - Free/paid / Bitdefender Free/paid + Malwarebytes free/paid with background scanning off - so as to not interfere with the primary antivirus)

I don't like:

- Anime (used to like it previously)
- Spicy food
- Bad companies/corporations/studios/etc. (as listed on a list that can be found on this blog's posts section)
- Facebook, TikTok (Sadly I'm pretty forced to use both IG and WhatsApp for family and friend-related discussions)
- Bullshit theories like the Earth is flat, COVID-19 is a hoax, COVID vaccine is bad/made to depopulate (who the heck thinks about these things and thinks "Yeah, that's a believable theory!")
- Religion (If you belive in religion, power to you, but don't try to indoctrinate me with that stuff, nor should you try to invite me to religion-related things)
- Old or unfunny memes (most notably most boomer FB memes)

# Life roadmap

*Not since birth, but since I started programming and stuff. Some years and events are missing from pretty obvious reasons about privacy

##### 2015

- First time editing HTML, CSS

##### 2016

- First time making a small mod for Minecraft PE
- First time making a texturepack for Minecraft PE

##### 2018

- Better PC (Not actually that good by today's standards. Dell Optiplex with Pentium D, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 Ultra 512MiB, 2GB of (pretty effing corrupt DDR2 RAM)
- Became very good at HTML, CSS, started using UE4
- JumpGame is developed and released (v.0.1), then subsequently cancelled in favour of GRAV0RTAL
- GRAV0RTAL is announced, a few devlogs will be released until 2020. Barely any development is made, considering I barely started using Unreal and still need more knowledge to create a project of this scale
- 2A Games is made (indie studio) with co-developer and long-time friend, Alin9700

##### 2019

- More GRAV0RTAL development updates are released
- Became better at Unreal Engine 4, already considering cancelling the project
- GRAV0RTAL is cancelled for the first time
- Portal Stories: New Age is ramping up for the announcement in 9 Dec 2019

##### 2020

- GRAV0RTAL is back. For realzies this time, I promise (Spoiler, cancelled the same year lmao)
- 2A Games is renamed to Evo-Catalyst Softworks
- TheVirus(TM) strikes Romania, antivaxxers are back, woo! (f--k them)
- Devlogs 1-2 are released for GRAV0RTAL
- Released a few soundtracks I sketched for GRAV0RTAL
- New PC, finally some good effing gaming ensues! (HP Compaq 8200 Elite, Intel Core i7-2600 vPro, now 9 years old, still holds VERY well, 8GB DDR3, AMD 512MB GPU, soon replaced with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
- New PC's PSU has issues and is replaced, thankfully nothing was lost
- Added an extra 500GB HDD that's possibly been running for 2+ years and shows signs of failure
- Evo-Catalyst Studios is renamed to Vanta Interactive (current name)
- Project C.U.B.E. is announced - no one seems to care anyway - then a few months later gets silently removed and cancelled
- GRAV0RTAL gets cancelled 5 days before Christmas. Merry Christmas! (or not)
- Unbeknownst to many, I cancelled everything publicly because I thought people would just get bored and lose interest if there's no progress to be shown, not only that, but I wanted to become better at Unreal 4.

##### 2021

- This website is made in the summer of 2021
- I get very addicted to HITMAN 2 and HITMAN III, also to YT Music
- Start a few modding projects that will not be worked on for quite some time considering it's all hands on deck for Project Hangar
- Scalenium development is started, no big announcement
- One year of Vanta Interactive not announcing anything, no one seems to care (actually good imo)
- Frosted Planet has a lot of issues with the artstyle, features, story, models. First I thought I would make it on a fictional planet that was frozen by humans in order to repopulate it, then I want it voxel-styled like ASTRONEER, then I want it NMS-style, then normal high-quality models style, which seemed to work for a while. Story gets written, promptly cancelled for the super secret Project Hangar.
- By this time, Unreal 5 Preview 2 was released, and as of September, I'm now pretty effing good at Unreal (4&5). Not an expert, but not a medium-level developer either. I also shifted every project to Unreal 5 and never looked back.
- This website gets more articles, content and now, this roadmap. Hi there!
- TheVirus(TM) Phase 4 (Delta variant) is almost here, woo!

*In case you're asking, no, I will not announce Project Hangar or the unnamed project until it's time. I will not do this crap ever again(GRAV0RTAL cancelled, announced again, cancelled again, slow progress, few lies mixed in for taste). This means for Project Hangar that I will likely announce it only a few short months before its release, by then play-testing, media is done, bug fixes are the highest priority and I'll start being active, releasing info about it.
