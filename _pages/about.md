# Who am I?

I'm a game and software developer, currently working on projects for Android, Windows and Linux. I also like to create music, videos, tech and game reviews, I hoard old and new tech, make weird inventions on both paper and IRL, I browse a lot of reddit, Twitter, Steam, Discord and YouTube, and listen to music on YT Music or Spotify a huge chunk of the day while coding or simply doing nothing. Furthermore, I'm Bi and a Furry.

Not only that, but I'm a fan of whatever devices Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple create, thankfully I also get the occasion from time to time to test such devices. 

**Keep in mind I am biased, like literally everyone else.** I prefer Kaspersky and Bitdefender over every single antivirus solution out there, extremely biased against Epic Games for their anti-consumer practices (excluding Unreal Engine, that is excellent for what I need), biased against Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, Facebook, TikTok, anti-vaxxers, and religion. Expect remarks about these companies and topics if we're talking about them in a post here.

I am trying to be as formal and professional as possible here, but emotions (anger, sadness, indifference) and biases may slip up sometimes. I apologize in advance if that happens.
