**Note on Scalenium** Scalenium has been cancelled, and is therefore deprecated. Moving forward, I will use Material You.

# The End of Scalenium

It is unfortunate that I have to announce that Scalenium is cancelled.

Scalenium was my own design system inspired by Google's Material Design, Material You, Apple's design system & Microsoft's Fluent Design.

The project kept running into walls, making barely any progress in the last 3 months. Therefore, I have cancelled it and saved myself more stress from trying to come up with something innovative that was in my opinion, doomed to fail anyway.

Moving forward, I will use Material You for all my apps. This includes Kalliope for reddit, which is still on track to come out in late 2022 or early 2023.



In other news, Project Hangar is very much in active development, and doesn't look like it's going to be cancelled any time soon. It is still on track to release in 2024.
