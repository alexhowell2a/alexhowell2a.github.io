# Scrap Mechanic is a Cyberpunk fail, and still in Early Access

Axolot Games, the publisher and developer - this is their only game in development - has made over $40 million in revenue in 2020, and has made millions for quite a long time, and they have not completed development on their game, which is still in Early Access, 6 years later.

# Game Review

Axolot Games has made millions over the course of the Scrap Mechanic development, and even after 6 years, the game is nowhere near completion. I will not post any in-game photos, this isn't a slideshow or a casual article, I'm tearing apart the issues with the game development industry and the issues with Axolot Games and Scrap Mechanic, because this is serious.

According to [dun&bradstreet](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.axolot_games_ab.9e2fe2fe18d366e95fd71f23ef8487f5.html)'s company profile of Axolot Games AB, they currently have 10 employees and their annual revenue in 2020 is **$40 million**. Seems like they actually fired 2 or 3 employees compared to the last time I checked on this website, one year ago.

Imagine, being an independent, indie game studio, which makes one game and publishes another (Raft, developed by RedBeet Interactive), and the studio makes millions for some time now, and even with all of this money, the sole game being developed is in a very ugly state.

# The biggest issues with Scrap Mechanic

## The game engine

The game engine they use is subpar for their needs, and especially subpar for any game in 2021. OGRE3D is the name of the engine, it's a pretty small engine, has fewer features than Unity, Godot, CryEngine and Unreal, and it's not made for something as big as Scrap Mechanic. Worse yet, Axolot has promised console support, which will never happen on this engine, since on the [Features](https://www.ogre3d.org/about/features) page from OGRE3D they literally do not mention console support. Axolot can have all the ideas in the world, but this crummy engine will not be able to pull all of that off.

My theory is that Axolot never expected all of this popularity for their (at the time) small game with good ideas, and now all they can do is pray the engine can handle their promises. Even if it would take years, I still hope that Axolot wakes up and smells the reality, and they switch to something like Unreal 4/5 or Unity and remake the game in its entirety. Disable the purchase option on the Steam store, announce that they've made quite the mistakes, but now they want to change it all, hire a lot more developers (I'd say 50 or so is enough) and start working.

## Balancing Issues

The drop rates and the bot difficulty are insane for the kind of relaxed gameplay Axolot is trying to do for Survival. Nice, I got jumped by three hay bots at once, they threw me from the stairs, I died like 2 times, respawned back in with awfully low health, hunger and thirst, and I'm still expected to beat them, but their hit boxes and the hit register are awful. Imagine, after this kind of terrible feeling, only to search through the crates and find a Tomato or a stupid Wok Milkshake, which won't saturate the gaping mouth of the mechanic.

## The enemies

The enemies in this game are unbalanced, the green Tote bots and the Hay bots seem pretty balanced, but the blue Tape bots and red explosive Tape bots are certainly not. One hit from the blue Tape bot halves your health, two hits or a horde of these robots, and you're dead.

## The mechanic

Poor guy moans each second when he's dying of hunger or thirst. Seriously, I do not want to hear something like that in a game that's supposed to be pretty realistic and focused on survival.

## The bugs

There are, even now, 6-year-old unfixed bugs. Huge lag spikes, extreme rubber banding in multiplayer due to their crappy peer-to-peer connectivity and poor optimization plague the game to this day and might never be fixed. It's actually getting weird, some people have low performance on low graphic settings but better performance on higher settings, like what's the logic here? The game only loads a few things when loading, so when you load in the menu and in any map for the first time after launching the game, it has to load EVERY single texture, slowly, maybe an obvious sign that the engine is struggling to keep up. So, if you play it on an HDD, you're basically screwed as you have to wait about 5-10 minutes to load every texture if you want pretty good performance.

There are still a lot of simple to fix bugs, put a few thrusters to a chair, turn it on and you can easily fall through the map, thankfully they made a teleporter to get you back to surface, but this shouldn't happen in the first place - if you have a good game that is -, the oxygen meter in Survival would dissapear from time to time, you can even encounter empty water chunks where instead of swimming you fall to the bottom and all you can do is walk and jump like on the surface.

## The intuitiveness

There is none. For someone new to this game, or even a small 8-year-old kid, this could be very hard to learn, the manual provided in-game is very confusing, it's not updated and certainly doesn't help. Try a little experiment if you have bought the game but never played, or return after 2 years of not playing the game (like me) and try to build a car, a simple 4 wheeled car, doors, small things like these, and I guarantee you will have issues which will result in watching YouTube videos to learn.

There is no sense of progression, pretty ironic how they can't make a Survival-oriented game mode when their other game they publish is literally called Raft and focuses on building and finding islands and items to build yourself a bigger raft. Here, you are just dropped in a burning spaceship and off you go, good luck.

## The community

I understand that there's a ton of children who play this game, and that is completely understandable, but more than 3/4 of them have no idea how the life is outside the curtain of lies and promises Axolot Games has made. Some genuinely good, constructive reviews have been hidden by developers during bigger sales, so they can make more sales.

# Shortened version of all of this

## The good

- Good, atmospheric, calming music - sadly sometimes it stops abruptly.

- Good ideas, bad execution.

- Good world generation

- Pretty graphics during the day, I could easily sit for a few in-game days and just admire the views.

## The bad

- Countless bugs that are present from the first release of the game, 6 years ago

- Bad multiplayer method, peer-to-peer is always bad compared to dedicated servers

## The ugly

- Lazy or incapable small team of developers

- Millions in the studio's bank account, most of the money is certainly not poured into improving the game

- Early Access after 6 years, game is halfway complete

- $25 price tag, after 6 years, with a few sales here and there.

- Community is filled with children who don't see outside the walls Axolot has created

# Conclusion

Do not buy this game, because you receive no guarantee it will be remade or finished. Go buy something like Satisfactory, Factorio, ASTRONEER and other titles which are way better than this $25 sham.
