# Apple Music

Siri can now play one of the many more new playlists curated by Apple Music's specialists, for a lot of moods or moments in your day. This function is now available to all Apple Music subscribers.

# Mac

### MacBook Pro

**M1 PRO** chipset, up to 70% better performance than M1. Up to 2x faster graphics performance than M1.

**M1 MAX** chipset, higher bandwidth, up to 400GB/s memory bandwidth. Largest chip Apple has ever built. Up to 4X faster GPU performance than M1.

TL;DR better and faster performance compared to M1, new universal apps like Cinema4D, Adobe Lightroom and more.

### MacBook Pro has a notch!

My opinion: looks pretty slick, but could have been better, or even an under-display camera.

16" and 14" variants.

Touchbar is gone, F1-F12 keys are back.

1x HDMI port, 1x Thunderbolt 4, 1x SDCard port

2x Thunderbolt 4 port on other side

MagSafe is back as well.

Connect up to 2 Pro Display XDR on M1 PRO, M1 MAX up to 3 and a 4K TV.
