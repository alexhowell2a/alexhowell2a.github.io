My own list of any company that you should avoid, that is regularly updated, usually once or twice a year. Most of the companies are game companies, but any other company may get on the list.

As of September 2021: (In not any specific order:)

### Tripwire Interactive LLC - Creators of ManEater, Killing Floor, Killing Floor 2, Rising Storm 2 - Vietnam, Chivarly 2

President of Tripwire Interactive speaks in favour of the recent Texas law that bans abortion for babies with a heartbeat. (Abortions after 6 weeks), and also offers a $10,000 bounty to any citizen who sues anyone performing abortions or assisting with the process. Basically is now a woman hater. Ironic, for a guy who is pro-life, as he makes a lot of games about killing.

### IO Interactive (IOI) - HITMAN III, HITMAN 2, HITMAN, Hitman: Absolution, Hitman Blood Money

Made a deal with Epic Games to keep their newest release, HITMAN III exclusive to the Epic Games Store for 1 year(until ~20 Jan 2022). This also affirms my theory: If you sell your game on PC as a EGS exclusive, you know that game is now ruined.

Not to my surprise, HITMAN III did not have a lot of content on release, is still pretty bland and uninspiring as of September 2021, still lacks some content from HITMAN and HITMAN 2, and did not sell well either, and on top of that, there's a $90 Deluxe Edition that doesn't even include the SEPARATE $30 Seven Deadly Sins pack that is an utter cash grab. Video review of the whole HITMAN trilogy is coming in 2022 on my channel, with my experience of HITMAN III on both XBOX Series X and PC, and spoiler - it's not great, but not horrible either.

### Crytek - Crysis Remastered Trilogy, Crysis 3, Crysis 2, Crysis, CryEngine

Made a deal with Epic Games to keep their newest release, Crysis Remastered Trilogy exclusive to the Epic Games Store for 1 year. Again, affirms my previously mentioned theory.

Crytek turned into nothing, they still own the Crysis IP but develop no new entry in the franchise, they're in massive financial distress, they blew millions on trying to sue Star Citizen in an extremely bad case that they lost (lol), and they only have one game that people talk about, and even that game performs only mediocrily. Even with the remastered trilogy, that's not even worth it, considering they look almost the same as the original games.

### Bethesda Game Studios / Bethesda - Fallout 76, Doom: Eternal, DOOM, Fallout 4, Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, RAGE 2

Other than DOOM and Doom: Eternal (developed by ID Software), their other games are released very buggy (Fallout 76, Fallout 4, Fallout VR). Is involved with predatory microtransaction practices, terrible customer support, terrible anti-consumer practices (Fallout 76 post-release merchandise and collector's edition issues)

### Electronic Arts (EA) - The Sims 4, Need For Speed: Heat, Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2012), The Sims 3, SimCity, BATTLEFIELD 2042, FIFA 21

Bought MAXIS, developer of The Sims franchise, SimCity franchise, shut down the SimCity servers and monetized the hell out of The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 ($860 worth of DLC only in Sims 4 as of September 2021). Involved in predatory microtransaction practices, creates terrible games that look almost the same as the older ones but with a new coat of paint (most notably the FIFA series). Everything they touch turns into shit. Every IP they develop/publish nowadays is just a money grab.

### Deep Silver (Deep Shillver, Deep Shitver, Deep Suckle, Deep Throating Silver) - Saints Row (reboot), Metro Exodus, Metro: Last Night, Metro 2033, Metro Redux

Went bankrupt previously, publishes both PC, Console and Mobile games. Published Metro Exodus to the Epic Games Store just days before the announced Steam release date. They honored the pre-orders, but still, a totally crapy move. Recently they announced the Saints Row reboot and its release on the EGS. You can literally see the blank space on the banner where the Steam icon would have been. Would not be surprised if this was another decision made very quickly.

### Epic Games (E-pig Games) - Fortnite, Unreal Tournament (UT4, unfinished), Unreal Tournament 3; Tencent and ultimately the CCP own a large portion of the company

Anti-consumer and anti-developer practices in the Epic Games Store, store lacks functional, basic features like a shopping cart, user reviews, and will never get such features, because E-pig confirmed it. Do NOT even claim their free games, that only adds to their numbers so they can boast even more to their investors. The store is bleeding money and will die no matter what Tim Sweeney (Swiney) does. The only thing keeping it afloat is Fortnite and Unreal Engine.

Even then, Fortnite is still to be criticized, as Fortnite copied PUBG, and Bluehole dropped their lawsuit against Epic only because Tencent has a finger in the pies of both companies, and now recently shamelessly stole Among Us' impostor game mode concept, without putting even a bit of work to twist it in their own way.

They snatch games from Steam, sometimes even just a few days before their release date (most notable example being Metro Exodus). Their so-called promise to not do it again was an absolute joke, as Anno 1800 was also another EGS exclusive - but don't worry, you could have pre-ordered it on Steam and wait a whole year until you get the game you were promised to get that year on that platform. They have also removed Rocket League from Steam as it's now an exclusive on Epic Games Store on PC, after they acquired Psyonix (developers of Rocket League). Involved into predatory microtransaction practices, absolutely horrendous customer experience and support, anti-developer and anti-consumer game store and game services, they're only staying afloat because of Fortnite and Unreal Engine, killed off a great franchise (Unreal Tournament).

### IGN - Known Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, Doritos, Mountain Dew shill

"You can't spell ignorant without IGN". Need I say more? Every AAA game studio has a finger in IGN's pie, and they put words in their reviewers' mouths.

### Kotaku - Known shill, writes terrible utter garbage just to cash in some money from clicks, possible CCP shill

Part of the Gawker Media empire, and they post clickbait. The editors are narcissist douchebags. They blatantly rob posts from places like reddit and Twitter and post them as their own and barely (if ever) give the OP credit. They come across as pretentions or too concerned about issues outside of gaming. Kotaku is a GAMING website that posts news, gaming reviews, tips and other gaming-related things, not freaking social issues.

### Ubisoft - Watch Dogs Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Far Cry 5

Bad PC ports, terrible downgrades (E3 vs retail comparisons on YouTube will show you more than enough evidence, most notably Rainbow Six Siege, The Division 2). Anti-consumer practices, predatory microtransactions, terrible games.

### CD Projekt Red S.A. - Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, The Witcher 2, The Witcher

Transphobic company, Cyberpunk 2077 was a miserable fail that was not even fixed almost 1 year later, a bucketload of promises were broken and never returned as updates. Ironic as Cyberpunk 2077's story is mostly about destroying corporations because they are evil, and CDPR's tweets like the infamous "We leave greed to others", yet CDPR has shown that they are nothing else but another gaming corp. that only wants money. Personally I will not trust them until they release another good game that has no such issues at release. I actually played a good chunk of Cyberpunk 2077 on release, and it was horrible and unplayable on the bare minimum GTX 1650. Thankfully I have received a refund, and will probably not play this game until it's **actually** complete.

### Axolot Games - Scrap Mechanic, Raft

Scrap Mechanic has been in Early Access for almost 6 years at this point, barely any big progress was made, updates are extremely slow, there are still bugs and glitches from the first public release present in the current version, multiplayer is a sham, the game will likely not get finished in less than 5 years.

### Take-Two Interactive w/ Rockstar Games, 2K Games - Borderlands 3, Borderlands 2, Grand Theft Auto Remastered Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption II

Probably known at this point, Rockstar Games acting under Take Two's legal cover, has DMCA-ed a lot of mods for the GTA 3D universe and a notable reverse engineering project about GTA III.

They were very pro-modding a few years ago, after a massive backlash when they removed OpenIV because they feared that players could modify GTA Online key files, and have gone as far as to even promote and talk about popular and up-and-coming mods on their news part of their website.

### Capcom (Crapcom) - Resident Evil Village, Street Fighter V, Resident Evil 3 Remake, Resident Evil 2 Remake, Monster Hunter World, Mega Man 11

Greedy developers, cannot fix simple issues like a stuttering issue in RE: Village (Even though apparently a cracking group managed to fix that). Resident Evil 2 Remake was halfassed, there's no regional pricing, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a fat cash grab.

### 505 Games - Terraria, CONTROL: Ultimate Edition, Death Stranding, Ghostrunner, Journey To The Savage Planet, Assetto Corsa Competizione, ABZU

High prices, some are at best mediocre games, shady practices, they published CONTROL: Ultimate Edition to the Epic Games Store for a year.



The end...for now.
