# Galaxy A22 5G seems impressive for its price, but only on paper.

This June's A22 5G is looking impressive on paper, but the software just isn't there.

I bought this phone a week ago, it's *better* in some cases, but sometimes worse than my A10.

# The pros and cons

Pros:
 - Better performance, runs most of the latest titles at a good framerate
 - Impressive 5,000 mAh battery
 - 90Hz 6.6" 1080p FHD+ display
 - 15W Fast Charging
 - 5G at an affordable price
 - Android 11, One UI Core 3.1

Cons:
 - Impressive-on-paper camera specs, in practice it can fail, a lot.
 - NFC is region-dependent
 - One UI Core instead of One UI, even if the phone is more than capable
 - A22 4G (LTE) is superior in some ways, and at least $50 cheaper

# Cameras

Cameras are likely a big talking point of most Samsung phones, and while this phone's cameras are acceptable, they fall very short compared to most phones at the same price range.

The Galaxy A22 5G features three rear and one front camera, only one of those can take photos comparable to the Galaxy A10 which I have been using for around a year and a half.

## Rear Cameras

The only camera that can hold a candle to the Galaxy A10 in most cases is the 48MP wide camera. I'm not kidding when I say that the other cameras are a joke. While using the 48MP camera I could not zoom in/out from the Camera app, so that could be an issue for some.

What I find very nice about this and many other phones is that they can take pictures even from behind a mosquito net without showing the net itself, although it only works on 1x zoom and on the wide camera, the 5MP ultrawide camera will show the net.

There is no Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on any cameras on the 5G variant unfortunately, which is quite disappointing. I know Samsung wants to cut corners and make good phones as cheap as they can, but i feel like they could have kept OIS among other features.

The wide camera's photos immediately show that it is weak, and perhaps should have been improved instead of getting downgraded from 8MP to 5MP. Same goes for the non-eistent 2MP macro camera from the 4G variant.

The video resolution is pretty uncommon, 1152P@30Fps, something I've rarely, if ever, encountered before.

It has a Night Mode which is more like Night Vision to me sometimes, a basic Pro mode, Panorama and a Snapchat ripoff mode with animated and static cat and dog ears.

## Front Camera

Same story here, A22 4G is better here as well, even though both look pretty similar and pretty low-res but good enough for video calls.

# Design

It is one of the more unique designs from the Galaxy A series, along with its 4G counterpart, and the Galaxy A72, A32, A32s, A52 phones, and the newly released A12. It is more common in the Galaxy M series, most notably the Galaxy M22 and the M32.

# Battery

5,000mAh is very respectable in this price range, and well reasoned, considering it has a 90Hz capable display. In my testing, watching YouTube videos at 60Hz, playing Call of Duty Mobile at Medium, 90Hz and a few more games at 90Hz and 60Hz respectively, using Twitter, Instagram and reddit at 90Hz and the casual note taking, it lasted me about a day on a single charge to 100%.

**Battery overheating:** The battery will heat up to a bit over my comfortable temperature and may get hot, this is likely to happen when using the 15W Fast Charge, which can be disabled from **Battery and device care > Battery > More battery settings**
{: .notice--warning}

# Performance

Respectable performance, has decent AR, smooth 90Hz display and very rarely hiccups or lag, heats up during a longer session, but no more than a conforable temperature.

# Conclusion
